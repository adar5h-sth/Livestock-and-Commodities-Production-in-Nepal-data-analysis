# 🐄 Agricultural and Livestock Data Analysis in Nepal

A data science project exploring agricultural and livestock trends across Nepalese districts using real-world datasets. The project involves data cleaning, interactive visualizations, and predictive modeling using linear regression.

## 📌 Overview

- 🔍 **Objective**: Analyze agricultural and livestock datasets from Nepal to uncover patterns and predict production metrics.
- 🛠️ **Tools**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Scikit-learn
- 📈 **ML Model**: Linear Regression for predictive analytics
- 📊 **Focus Areas**: EDA, data visualization, machine learning, performance evaluation

## 📂 Datasets

The project uses multiple datasets including:

- 🐎 Horse population by district  
- 🐄 Milk animals and milk production  
- 🍖 Meat production  
- 🐑 Wool and egg production  
- 🐇 Rabbit and 🐃 Yak population

## 🧰 Libraries Used

- `pandas` - Data manipulation
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` - Static data visualization
- `plotly` - Interactive visualizations
- `scikit-learn` - Linear regression, model evaluation
- `numpy` - Numerical operations

## 📊 Model Summary

Built a **Linear Regression** model to predict agricultural outputs using livestock features. Evaluated using:

- 📏 **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- 📈 **R² Score**

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Identified regional disparities in production metrics.
- Found strong correlation between livestock population and outputs like milk and meat.
- Detected outliers and potential areas for agricultural optimization.
